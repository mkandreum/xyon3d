# PWA Icons Placeholder
# Place your generated icons in this directory
# Required sizes: 72x72, 96x96, 128x128, 144x144, 152x152, 192x192, 384x384, 512x512

# To generate icons:
# 1. Create a 512x512 PNG source image (icon-source.png)
# 2. Run: .\generate-icons.ps1
# Or use an online tool like: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

# For now, you can use a simple colored square as placeholder
# The app will work without icons, but won't be installable as PWA
